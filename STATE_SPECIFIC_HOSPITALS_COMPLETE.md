```python
def _get_city_state(self, city: str) -> str:

    city_state_map = {

        'mumbai': 'Maharashtra',
        'bangalore': 'Karnataka',
        'chennai': 'Tamil Nadu',
        'kolkata': 'West Bengal',
        'hyderabad': 'Telangana',
        'pune': 'Maharashtra',
        'ahmedabad': 'Gujarat'
    }
    return city_state_map.get(city.lower(), 'Delhi')

# Filter hospitals by STATE ONLY
state_hospitals = [h for h in self.hospitals if h['state'].lower() == user_state.lower()]
```

#### **Hospital Database by State:**
- **Delhi**: 4 hospitals
- **Maharashtra**: 8 hospitals (Mumbai + Pune)
