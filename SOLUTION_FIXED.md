```bash
python test_models_only.py
```
**Expected Output:**
```
🎉 All ML models are working correctly!
You can now start the server with: python start_platform.py
```

### **Step 3: Start the Platform**
```bash
python simple_start.py
```
**Expected Output:**
```
🏥 Starting Health AI Platform...
📍 Platform will be available at: http://localhost:5000

- `start_platform.bat` - Windows batch file
- `start_platform.sh` - Linux/Mac shell script

### **Fixed Files:**
- `test_enhanced_platform.py` - Added missing `sys` import
- `simple_backend/app.py` - Fixed ML model path
- `requirements.txt` - Updated with all dependencies

## 📋 **Quick Commands:**

```bash
# Test models only
python test_models_only.py

# Start platform
python simple_start.py

# Windows batch
start_platform.bat

# Linux/Mac
./start_platform.sh
```

## 🎯 **What You Can Do Now:**

1. **Nutrition Consultation:**
   - "I want to lose weight, what should I eat?"
