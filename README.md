   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

4. **Run the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**1. OpenAI API Key Issues**
- Make sure you have a valid OpenAI API key
- Check that the key is correctly set in your `.env` file
- Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account

**2. Backend Not Starting**
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Verify all Python dependencies are installed
- Check the console for error messages

**3. Frontend Not Loading**
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check if port 3000 is available

**4. API Connection Issues**
- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:8000
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Ensure VITE_API_BASE_URL is set correctly

**5. Image Upload Issues**
- Check file size (max 5MB)
- Ensure file is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Verify backend image processing is working

#### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
4. Check that both frontend and backend are running
